**Below are four graphs, each of which is defined by the sets of nodes, initial nodes, final nodes,
edges, and defs and uses. Each graph also contains some test paths. Answer the following
questions about each graph.**

**(a) Draw the graph.** <br>
**(b) List all of the du-paths with respect to x. (Note: Include all-du-paths, even those that
are subpaths of some other du-path).**<br>
**(c) Determine which du-paths each test path tours. Write them in a table with test paths
in the first column and the du-paths they cover in the second column. For this part of
the exercise, you should consider both direct touring and sidetrips.**<br>
**(d) List a minimal test set that satisfies all defs coverage with respect to x. (Direct tours
only.) Use the given test paths.**<br>
**(e) List a minimal test set that satisfies all uses coverage with respect to x. (Direct tours
only.) Use the given test paths.**<br>
**(f) List a minimal test set that satisfies all-du-paths coverage with respect to x. (Direct
tours only.) Use the given test paths.**<br>
