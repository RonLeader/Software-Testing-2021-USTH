**(a) Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault
precisely by proposing a modification to the code.**
**(b) If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If
not, briefly explain why not.**
**(c) If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not
result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.**
**(d) If possible give a test case that results in an error, but not a
failure. If not, briefly explain why not. Hint: Don’t forget about
the program counter.**
