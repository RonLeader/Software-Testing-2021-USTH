**Write down all 16 tests to satisfy the Multiple Base Choice Coverage (MBCC) for the second
categorization of triang()’s inputs in Table 6.2. Use the values in Table 6.3.**

```The text suggests both ‘2’ and ‘1’ base choices for side 1. (Other sides still have 1 base choice
of ‘2’). This give two base tests: (2; 2; 2) and (1; 2; 2). According to the formula given in the
text, we get 2(base) + 4 + 6 + 6 = 18 tests. However, 2 of these are unnecessary, so the result
is 16.

There will be 16 different tests:
[ (2; 2; 2); (0; 2; 2); (−1; 2; 2) (2; 1; 2); 
(2; 0; 2); (2; −1; 2);(2; 2; 1); (2; 2; 0); 
(2; 2; −1); (1; 2; 2);(1; 1; 2); (1; 0; 2); 
(1; −1; 2); (1; 2; 1); (1; 2; 0); (1; 2; −1) ]

```
